# PriceSage

**PriceSage** is a Python-based price comparison and tracking tool that scrapes **Amazon India** and **Flipkart** for product prices. It fetches product details such as **title**, **price**, **rating**, and **review count**, compares them, and identifies the **best deal**.  

With automation, PriceSage can **run multiple times a day**, updating the CSV only with products whose prices have changed, making it a **daily price tracker**.
